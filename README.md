# github.io
- The use of github.io to host my resume as a website
# Online Presence
- Being able to serach up your resume on the internet besides having to carry around a document or having to print one is the best in my opinion
- Maybe having a google docs sharing link for my resume could also suffice.
# Use
- Have HTML, CSS, and Javascript scripts in a reposititory to be called upon by the main page.
